Q1
	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
		Client was The Gaming Room.
		They wanted us to design the document with following specifications
		the client has requested that the following software requirements be met for the game application:
		•	A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
		•	Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
		•	Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
		•	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers 
			for each instance of a game, team, or player.
Q2 
	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
		One thing that i feel i did good was by comparing and contrasting different operating system based on evidence.Like when selecting an operating
		system I chose time sharing operating system and i provided proper evidence and supporting points to back my argument.So in whole of the document
		the arguments are made based on evidence and thats what i feel i did great thoroughout the development of the docuemnt

Q3
	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
		I found it very very helpful.Like if you go to the start where different requirements of client was mentioned there was domanin model as well 
		as class diagram in the document.So developing the system based on players and teams became so very easy as we had understood what attributes,
		functions will be present in the system and while developing classes it became very easy to make it.
		Had there been no software design document we would have to make lot of effort at run time to make structure and it would not have been of best
		quality.
		So design document was a great great help overall while i was coding.

Q4.
	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
		I would want to revise the Client side comparison of different operating system w.r.t gaming room.In my opinion the comparison here are quiet general
		and not as specific to gaming room as it should be.So i would really want to revise this part.

Q5.
	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
		User needs are very ery important while designing any system.I perceive the user needs as building blocks of the whole system.For me the requirement
		document is the most important part of any system.
		User needs are very important to develop a good system and there are various reasons of it.
		•	If the requirement is to play a multiplayer game,and you make single player game without discussing requirements ,then the cost of 
			restructuring will be way bigger than developement
		•	To know the exact design requirement of client so that at the end,there is no conflict between two parties
		
		So these are the few reasons why requirement document is a must.It saves effort,time and cost
Q6
	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
		First careful understanding of the requirement is what i do.Then i figure out the entities involved in it and make the structure like domain model.
		Then i check the constraints and then i start devlopement.Coming to future stratigies,what i will do additionally is i will gather requirements,
		make structure and i will analyze similar softwares,the problems they faced,how they overcome it so that i get better understanding beforetime to remove
		risk of any malfunctionality.
		So these are few things i would be using in future
